# Site images

Put your images here. They are served from the site root on Vercel and in local dev.

**Paths in config:** Use paths starting with `/images/`, e.g.:

- `/images/hero.jpg` — hero banner
- `/images/about.jpg` — about section
- `/images/benefits.jpg` — benefits/conditions section

Update `src/config.js` and set:

- `heroImage: '/images/hero.jpg'`
- `aboutImage: '/images/about.jpg'`
- `benefitsImage: '/images/benefits.jpg'`

Recommended sizes (approx.): hero 1200×800, about 800×600, benefits 800×500.
